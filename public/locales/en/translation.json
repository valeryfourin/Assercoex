For an accurate calculation, send your approximate order and you will get the current prices for the items you are interested in as soon as possible.",

        "q9": "What is a fixed order?",
        "a9": "Usually the rose is purchased in open market, so the price fluctuates weekly. But if you want fixed prices throughout the year, you can choose our fixed orders.",
        "q10": "How can I pay for the order?",
        "a10": "The payment is made through a bank transfer in dollars to our accounts in Ecuador, US or Panama. For more information and other ways of payment, please contact your sales executive."
